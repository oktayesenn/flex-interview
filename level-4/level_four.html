          This was the first album I came out with. I was young when I first
          moved to New Jersey. This was my view of New York City, and every
          night I made sure to catch the sunset as it drove my inspiration.

      <h2>The Real Life</h2>

      <h4><del>$15.00</del> $10.00</h4>
      <p>
        I originally was born and raised on the farmlands taking care of all the
        animals. This album is about my roots and how they are still and will
        always be a central part of me.

      <h2>Under Pressure</h2>
      <img src="img/mic.jpg" alt="mic" class="album" />
      <h4>$15.00</h4>
      <p>
        When I started singing I was going through a break up and I was always
        under pressure to be a certain way. On stage I felt like I needed to be
        something I wasn't. This album is about that internal struggle.

      <h2>Waterworks</h2>
      <img src="img/rain.jpg" alt="rain" class="album" />
      <h4>$15.00</h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes, in your quest to make everyone else happy, you make yourself
        miserable. You cant make everyone happy, you're not pizza! Despite the
        cover, this was one of my happier albums.

      <h2>Picking It Up</h2>
      <img src="img/bedroom.jpg" alt="bedroom" class="album" />
      <h4>$15.00</h4>
      <p>
        My most recent fifth album is here! This was made while I was forced to
        stay at home. I got really experimental with this album. I really went
        for it and poured my heart out for my fans. I hope you enjoy!
