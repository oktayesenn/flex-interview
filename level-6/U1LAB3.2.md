# Flexbox Interview

### Teacher Notes

This lab is a way for students to get some at bats at applying CSS Flexbox to pre-written HTML code. The main section focusses on tackling individual parts of a webpage such as the sidebar, footer, etc. In the extension, students will have two opportunities to use both Grid and Flexbox simultaneously to bring these different parts together completing a full webpage. 

DISCLAIMER: The order of the two extension questions are interchangeable. #5 is slightly more challenging than #6 as it requires the copying and pasting of code from various files into one. This can cause some errors that are good to troubleshoot through, but are not the intent of such a lesson. Despite #5 being more challenging, it is a natural continuation of the previous levels 1-4 which is why it is originally placed as #5. 

### Prompt

You're applying for a different position, and this employer wants to see that you are proficient with using CSS Flexbox to style a webpage. The company is currently being hired to make a website for a musician. They've separated the task into separate parts to progressively test your competency before giving you the job.

**Directions**: Your task is to now use only Flexbox to style the CSS for each level matching the corresponding mock ups. [Use this resource](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to refer to for support throughout the different levels.

1. For this first layout, you'll want to use `flex-direction` and `align-items` to shift the sidebar items to the right side of the `div`. As always, don't forget to also include `display: flex;`.

2. Most websites have a navbar. This one has 2! In the first navbar you'll need to use `align-items`, and in the second, you'll need both `align-items` and `justify-content`. As always, don't forget to also include `display: flex;` in both rulesets. NOTE: the default `flex-direction` is `row`, so we don't need to specify it for these navbars.

3. Things get a bit trickier for the footer here in level 3. There are 4 parts to this that will need adjusting.
    - First, `display: flex` and use `justify-content` in your footer to spread out the three sections of the footer.
    - Then, `display: flex` and use `flex-direction` for each column in the footer.
    - Next, `display: flex` and use `align-items` for each title class.
    - Last, find the IDs for, and create 2 new rulesets for the first and third item in the footer. Use `justify-content` to spread them apart.

4. The last part of the webpage we'll modify is the main body containing the album cards which each have a title, an album cover, a price, and a description. 
    - For the whole container, use `justify-content` and `flex-wrap` to center the cards and allow them to go to a new line when minimizing the screen.
    - For each container item, use `flex-direction` and `align-items` to vertically center the contents of each card as depicted below.

  

### Culturally Responsive Best Practice

Then pictures and descriptions are made up for this lab. Feel empowered to change the generic theme pasted on the website to fit the identities of your students. 

As another extension, for example, students can add more photos and descriptions or refactor the existing ones to be a band, director or publishing company they like.

### Extra Help?

There are so many rulesets. How do I know which one to include `display: flex;` and everything else? There are 2 types of Felxbox properties: Parent properties, on the left of [this Flexbox documentation](), and Children properties on the right side. In the example below, copied from level2, the `div` with the `id="navbar-one"` is the parent container. All the `divs` inside with the `class="item"` are children items. Therefore, to use `Flexbox` for this navbar section, properties like `display: flex;` and `align-items: center;` (both parent properties) should be in the CSS ruleset `#navbar-one`. Properties like `align-self: flex-end;` (a child property) would be applied to the individual item to be affected. HINT: None of the problems above require the use of children properties.

```html
<!-- First Nav Bar -->
<div id="navbar-one">
    <div class="item" id="logo">
        <div id="circle"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="item page">Home</div>
    <div class="item page">Music</div>
    <div class="item page">Blog</div>
    <div class="item page">Podcast</div>
    <div class="item page">About</div>
    <div class="item page">FAQ</div>
    <div class="item page">Contact</div>
</div>
```

### Extensions

**Directions**:

5. Now that you've completed the individual parts of the website, it's time to put it all together into one site. Copy and paste the individual HTML levels 1-4 into the main `level_five.html`. Do the same with all the individual CSS code -- put it into the one `level_five.css`. The goal will be to use Grid to orient the page so that it looks like _"Mock Up 5"_ below. There are a couple of things you should _delete_ before doing this:
    - In the `.sidebar` ruleset, delete `width: 150px;` and
  `height: 100vh;`. You will replace this with grid.
    - In the `.footer` ruleset, delete `position: fixed;` and `width: 100%;` for the same reason



6. Another client has a vision for a website. They have put all the information for the main page together in `level_six.html` along with some basic styling in `level_six.css`. Here you will need to use Grid **and** Flexbox to get the page in order. Line it up to the Mock Up design below.
